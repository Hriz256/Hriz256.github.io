This file contains information for Orcad network licensing customers. 
<p>
If you are having difficulty installing your network license software, there is online documentation available to help. The Orcad Network Licensing Guide and the FlexLM End User Manual (for FLEXid users) are available for your reference. To access an online book (.PDF), you must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your system.<BR>
<BR>
When you install Orcad products, you are also asked if you want to install Acrobat Reader, if you do not already have Acrobat Reader on your system. If you have an earlier version of Acrobat Reader on your system, you will need to uninstall the earlier version and reboot your system before installing Acrobat Reader 4.05.
<p>
Follow these steps to install Acrobat Reader:
<ol>
	<li>From the Start menu, click Run.
	<li>Click Browse.
	<li>Enter the following path: N:\Adobe\Setup.exe (where "N" is the letter of your CD drive).
