<br>

<b><a name="hiernet">Hierarchical netlisting</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You now have the option of generating hierarchical simulation netlists as well as flat simulation netlists for your hierarchical designs. With hierarchical netlists, you can define default parameter values for a subcircuit, and override them by "passing" parameters via its occurrence in the parent schematic. Cross-probing between the front-end design entry tool and PSpice at the lower level circuits of a hierarchical design will work as it does with flat netlists.  In Capture's Project Manager, select the design, then select Tools/Create Netlist… and look at the PSpice Tab.  In PSpice Schematics, select Options/Netlist Setting…



<p><b><a name="pincurrents">Measuring pin currents on subcircuits</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You can now view pin-current waveforms on any part that is represented by a PSpice subcircuit (.SUBCKT) model. These measurements are available via cross-probing with current markers in the schematic, and are available as traces to add in Probe windows. Using hierarchical netlisting allows pin current measurement for hierarchical parts in the schematic.



<p><b><a name="pwr">Measuring power consumption of devices</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You can also measure the power consumption of a particular device by using the new power markers in the schematic, or by adding the corresponding trace in Probe. You can access power markers in the same way you access current and voltage markers. Power markers are annotated with "W" and are available in the toolbar. They attach to the center of parts in the schematic.

<p><font color=red><i><b>Note:</b>  You can also use passive and discrete semiconductor parts (resistors and transistors) to accurately model pin currents and power consumption. Macromodels (operational amplifiers) do not necessarily do so. Macromodels are simplified to reduce simulation time and complexity. They only model essential characteristics like bandwidth, clamping to rails, current limiting, etc.
<b>This feature is not available for digital parts.</b></i></font>



<p><b><a name="plottempl">Plot window templates in Probe windows</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You can create and reuse custom displays in Probe with defined arguments using plot window templates. A plot window template is a pre-defined plot window wherein one or more of the traces is an argument that can be identified using markers in the schematic, or by selecting a trace in the Probe window. Select PSpice/Markers/Plot Window Templates… in Capture to use templates and identify their arguments with markers.  Select Window/Display Control… in PSpice, and select the Templates tab, to create new templates or use existing ones by selecting traces from the list.


<p><b><a name="preempt">Preemptive simulation</a></b> (not available with PSpice A/D Basics or PSpice Lite)

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You now have more control over how multiple simulations are handled by PSpice and PSpice A/D, with the new Simulation Manager. You can preempt the currently active simulation and run another one ahead of it, and complete the paused simulation later. The Simulation Manager replaces the simulation queue functionality in PSpice 9.0 and 9.1.  You can still add and remove simulations, and reorder the sequence of batch simulations waiting in the queue to insure that the most important jobs are run first.  When needed, the Simulation Manager will appear as an icon in the system tray of the Windows taskbar, and can be opened from PSpice by selecting View/Simulation Queue.

<p><font color=red><i><b>Note:</b>  For network installations, if either PSpice is running or there is a simulation running in the Simulation Manager, a PSpice network license will be engaged. If all of the simulations are paused or stopped in the Simulation Manager, and you do not have PSpice running, the PSpice network license will be freed up for use by another user. </i></font>

<p><b><a name="interact">Interactive simulation</a></b> (not available with PSpice A/D Basics)

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You can interactively pause a simulation, change certain simulation parameters, and then continue the simulation from the point at which it was paused using the new values. By interacting with the simulation while it is running you can improve convergence or make other adjustments that will maximize the efficiency of the simulation run. During a transient analysis, pause the simulation, and then select Simulation/Edit Runtime Settings... in PSpice to see the parameters that can be changed.



<p><b><a name="data">Enhancements to options for limiting data collection</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>You now have greater control and flexibility over what types of data, and how much data, is collected and saved during a particular simulation.  See the Data Collection tab in the Simulation Settings dialog for the enhanced options.

<b><a name="docerr">Documentation errata</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>There are no known errors in the documentation for Release 9.2.



<p><b><a name="repprobs">Reported PSpice problems</a></b>

<font face="Arial" size=2>

<br>The following problems have been reported and are not fixed in Release 9.2. This list is intended to cite the most serious problems and is not an exhaustive list of all known problems. Many of these problems have workarounds.

<ul>

	<br><li>SCR15834/15631

	<br>Ability to interactively override schedule function; can't override scheduled changes using TMAX.

	<p>Problem description: 

	<br>When TMAX is scheduled, it cannot be changed if the simulation has been paused automatically due to a convergence failure. Any changes to the value of TMAX under this condition will not be saved or recognized by PSpice if the simulation is resumed. 
There is no workaround for this situation.

	<br>There is no workaround for this situation.

</ul>
<ul>

	<br><li>SCR16078/16385/16367/16317 
	
<br>When using PSpice with Capture some instances of simsrvr.exe processes may be orphaned.

<p>Problem description: 
<br>
When using PSpice with Capture, under certain circumstances it is possible to have some instances of simsrvr.exe left running. This will tie up minimal memory. 
	<p>Workaround:
	<br>If a performance issue is suspected, close Capture and PSpice and terminate all instances of the simsrvr.exe using the Task Manager [Ctrl+Alt+Delete].
</ul>
<ul>
<br><li>SCR16157

<br>Any changes made to the .opt file may not be saved when using Optimizer started from inside Capture.

<p>Problem description: 
<br>After opening Optimizer from Capture and editing parameters and specifications in a Optimizer file (.opt), the changes are not retained after saving and closing the file.
	<p>Workaround:
	<br>Open Optimizer from the Windows <b>Start</b> menu, <b>Programs</b> file.</p>
	<p>Step-by-step instructions
<br>To edit a parameter or specification: 

<ol start="1">
<li>From the Windows Start menu, select Programs, then find and open PSpice Optimizer.</li>
<li>Open the .opt file you want to edit.</li> 
<li>From the Edit menu in Optimizer menu, select Parameters…
 <br><i>or</i>
 <br>Specifications…</li>
<li>Add, change, delete, copy, or insert your parameter or specification.</li>
<li>Close the Editing Dialog box.</li>
<li>From the File menu, click Save.</li>

<br>You can now open your design in Capture and run Optimizer on the edited file.</ol></p>
</ul>
<ul>

	<br><li>SCR16288 
	
<br>"INTERNAL ERROR -- The Probe file is corrupt" when a noise analysis (.NOISE) is run.

<p>Problem description: 
<br>
When viewing the simulation results from a noise analysis, the above error is displayed.
	<p>Workaround:
	<br>Contact Technical Support for an update which corrects this problem.
</ul>
<ul>

	<br><li>SCR16299 
	
<br>Deleting a marker does not remove the corresponding trace from the Probe display.

<p>Problem description: 
<br>
After deleting a marker in Capture, the corresponding trace remains in Probe. 
	<p>Workaround:
	<br>1. Delete the trace manually in Probe.
<br>2. Contact Technical Support for an update which corrects this problem.
